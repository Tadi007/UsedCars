This repo presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python of the Cars24 resale 
dataset. Detailed data analysis and machine learning venture focusing on the Indian used car 
market.  
 
Objective: 
To explore and explain how different features of a car affect its resale value, and what patterns 
exist in the Indian used car market. 
By studying key factors such as car age, mileage, ownership history, fuel type, transmission, 
and location, the project aims to: 
1. Understand market trends in the resale of different car types. 
2. Identify key factors influencing resale price, such as car-age, distance driven, and 
number of owners. 
3. Compare the resale value of popular brands and models, highlighting which cars 
retain value better. 
4. Provide actionable insights that can help buyers, sellers, and businesses make 
informed decisions in the second-hand automobile market. 
5. Build a foundation for predictive modeling, where machine learning could eventually 
estimate resale prices based on car specifications.
