# Overview

This repo presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python of the Cars24 resale 
dataset. Detailed data analysis and machine learning venture focusing on the Indian used car 
market.  
 
Objective: 
To explore and explain how different features of a car affect its resale value, and what patterns 
exist in the Indian used car market. 
By studying key factors such as car age, mileage, ownership history, fuel type, transmission, 
and location, the project aims to: 
1. Understand market trends in the resale of different car types. 
2. Identify key factors influencing resale price, such as car-age, distance driven, and 
number of owners. 
3. Compare the resale value of popular brands and models, highlighting which cars 
retain value better. 
4. Provide actionable insights that can help buyers, sellers, and businesses make 
informed decisions in the second-hand automobile market. 
5. Build a foundation for predictive modeling, where machine learning could eventually 
estimate resale prices based on car specifications.

# Dataset
The dataset contains detailed information on used cars, including their specifications and resale 
pricing details. The dataset consists of approximately 8,015 rows and 9 columns, covering a 
diverse range of vehicles such as hatchbacks, sedans, SUVs, luxury SUVs, and luxury 
sedans.

# Case Highlights  
 
1. The most expensive car in the dataset is a 2022 Toyota Fortuner at 33 lakhs. Despite being 3 
years old, its low mileage and single ownership allow it to retain strong value.  
2. The cheapest car is a 2010 Maruti Alto at 1.19 lakhs. Even after 15 years, it retains some value 
due to affordability, low maintenance, and market demand.  
3. This contrast highlights how SUVs and luxury cars hold premium value, while budget 
hatchbacks continue to circulate in older resale markets. 
 
# Conclusions & Business Implications 
 
1. The prime resale window is between 3â€“7 years, where cars balance value retention and buyer 
demand.  
2. Petrol cars dominate supply, while CNG is growing steadily as an alternative fuel option.  
3. Manual cars dominate in numbers, but automatics fetch higher prices and will likely gain 
more share.  
4. Single-owner, low-mileage cars have the strongest resale value and buyer trust.  
5. Resale platforms should emphasize these trends in pricing models and customer marketing 
strategies.
